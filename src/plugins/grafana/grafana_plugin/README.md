## What is Grafana Data Source Pixie Backend Plugin?

Execute pxl scripts and visualize Pixie data in Grafana dashboards.

## Getting started

A data source backend plugin consists of both frontend and backend components.

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn watch
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

### Backend

1. Update [Grafana plugin SDK for Go](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/grafana-plugin-sdk-for-go/) dependency to the latest minor version:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go
   ```

2. Build backend plugin binaries for Linux and Darwin (Windows still in progress):

   ```bash
   bazel build //src/plugins/grafana/grafana-plugin/pkg/...
   ```
