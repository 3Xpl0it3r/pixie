# TODO(oazizi): Ideally, we would use pl_bpf_preprocess and feed it to pl_cc_resource
# as an input, but that turns out to be a bit more tricky, since bl_cc_resource would
# then have to understand both labels and sources as inputs. So for now, use bl_bpf_cc_resource
# which automatically calls pl_bpf_preprocess under the hood.

# Leaving the bl_bpf_preprocess targets in here only for debug/observability, but keep
# in mind that they are not actively used targets.
