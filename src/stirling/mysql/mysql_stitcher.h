 * packets.
 * @param state: MySQL state from previous "statement" requests (i.e. state from prepared
 * statements).
 * @param entry: entry where details of the request and responses are populated.
 * @return There are two possible normal outcomes for each request (success or needs-more-data),
 *         in addition to error cases. Resp packets are only consumed on success.
 *         Needs-more-data simply indicates that not all response packets were present.
 *         Error are communicated through Status, and indicate an unexpected packet.
 *         This usually means we have lost track of the connection.
 *         Note that errors are communicated through Status and include an error message.
