# signals such as SIGTERM and SIGINT. In particular, it is important that
# Stirling not leave any attached kprobes, as these won't be cleaned up by
# the kernel.
#
# Note: the following command can be used to remove all kprobes, if needed.
#    sudo sh -c 'echo > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/kprobe_events'
#
# Perf buffers and perf events are assigned file descriptors,
# so hopefully the kernel gets rid of them when the process dies, right?

# TODO(oazizi): Expose these as arguments, if necessary
# Amount of time we give the executable to start up and deploy kprobes.
Tstart=3

# Amount of time after start, after which we kill the executable.
