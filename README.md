## What is Pixie?

<img src="./.readme_assets/live_2oct20.gif" alt="Pixie" width="425" align="right">

Pixie gives you instant visibility by giving access to metrics, events, traces and logs without changing code.

## Quick Start

Review Pixie's [requirements](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/installing-pixie/requirements/) to make sure that your Kubernetes cluster is supported.

#### Signup

Visit our [product page](https://work.withpixie.ai/) and signup with your google account.

#### Install CLI

Run the command below:

`bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://withpixie.ai/install.sh)"`

Or see our [Installation Docs](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/installing-pixie/quick-start/#2.-install-the-cli) to install Pixie using Docker, Debian, RPM or with the latest binary.

#### (optional) Setup a sandbox

If you don't already have a K8s cluster available, you can use Minikube to set-up a local environment:

- On Linux, run `minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=6000 --driver=kvm2 -p=<cluster-name>`. The default `docker` driver is not currently supported, so using the `kvm2` driver is important.

- On Mac, run `minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=6000 -p=<cluster-name>`.

More detailed instructions are available [here](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/installing-pixie/install-guides/minikube-setup/).

Start a demo-app:

- Deploy [Weaveworks'](https://www.weave.works/) [sock-shop](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo) demo app by running `px demo deploy px-sock-shop`

#### üöÄ Deploy Pixie

Use the CLI to deploy the Pixie Platform in your K8s cluster by running:

px deploy

Alternatively, you can deploy with [YAML](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/installing-pixie/install-schemes/yaml/) or [Helm](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/installing-pixie/install-schemes/helm/).

<br>

Check out our [install guides](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/installing-pixie/install-guides/) and [walkthrough videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMh2f8abTYU) for alternate install schemes.

## Get Instant Auto-Telemetry

#### Run scripts with `px` CLI

<img src="/.readme_assets/http_data.svg" alt="CLI Demo" width="425" align="right">

<br> Service SLA:

`px run px/service_stats`

<br> Node health:

`px run px/node_stats`

<br> MySQL metrics:

`px run px/mysql_stats`

<br> Explore more scripts by running:

`px scripts list`

<br> Check out our [pxl_scripts](src/pxl_scripts) folder for more examples.

<br clear="all">

#### View machine generated dashboards with Live views

<img src="./.readme_assets/live_2oct20.gif" alt="CLI Demo" width="425" align="right">

The Pixie Platform auto-generates "Live View" dashboard to visualize script results.

You can view them by clicking on the URLs prompted by `px` or by visiting:

`https://work.withpixie.ai/live`

<br clear="all">

#### Pipe Pixie dust into any tool

<img src="./.readme_assets/cli_demo.svg" alt="CLI Demo" width="425" align="right">

You can transform and pipe your script results into any other system or workflow by consuming `px` results with tools like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

Example with http_data:

`px run px/http_data -o json| jq -r .`

More examples [here](src/pxl_scripts)

<br>_To see more script examples and learn how to write your own, check out our [docs](https://work.withpixie.ai/docs) for more guides_

## Under the Hood

Three fundamental innovations enable Pixie's magical developer experience:

**Progressive Instrumentation:** Pixie Edge Modules (‚ÄúPEMs‚Äù) collect full body request traces (via eBPF), system metrics & K8s events without the need for code-changes and at less than 5% overhead. Custom metrics, traces & logs can be integrated into the Pixie Command Module.

**In-Cluster Edge Compute:** The Pixie Command Module is deployed in your K8s cluster to isolate data storage and computation within your environment for drastically better intelligence, performance & security.

**Command Driven Interfaces:** Programmatically access data via the Pixie CLI and Pixie UI which are designed ground-up to allow you to run analysis & debug scenarios faster than any other developer tool.
