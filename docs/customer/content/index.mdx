**Welcome to Pixie Docs!** 

This documentation is a reference guide for how to set-up and use Pixie.

We are currently in closed beta which includes our no-instrumentation edge monitoring back-end and a very early version of our user-interface. We are currently designing opinionated user-interfaces necessary for broader usage based on feedback from early users like you. 

Weâ€™d love to hear from you so feel free to share feedback by dropping us a message on Slack or email at <cs@pixielabs.ai>.
