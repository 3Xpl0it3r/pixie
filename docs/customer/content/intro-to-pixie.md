Pixie is no-touch edge monitoring for Kubernetes

Pixie helps on-call engineers isolate performance bottlenecks in their service or infra layer after higher-order metrics (SLI's) based alerts are fired. It's powered by inter-service transaction data harvested using eBPF (no instrumentation, low overhead) and a decentralized architecture which stores & alerts in-memory (no data leaves K8s cluster). It takes 30 secs to deploy and integrates as a triage engine with the Prometheus monitoring stack (Prometheus + Alert Manager + Grafana/DataDog).
