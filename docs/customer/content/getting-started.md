**Pixie is a zero-touch unsampled edge monitoring system for Kubernetes.**

We are in the midst of an architectural shift towards hybrid-cloud, containers & microservices to gain velocity, agility, and resilience. However, we still burn months instrumenting and hours isolating bottlenecks during outages.

What if we could re-engineer monitoring to cut triage down to minutes without burning months instrumenting?
