## bpftrace notes

When building bpftrace, it automatically generates the following file:
<build_dir>/resources/headers.cpp

Due to build issues, this file was copied directly into bpftrace/src, and checked in to our fork of bpftrace.

If at any time, bpftrace is updated from the origin, AND there are changes to the bpftrace/resources directory,
then the updated headers.cpp should be copied and checked in to bpftrace/src.

If there are no changes to files in the bpftrace/resources directory (which is the likely case), then no special steps are required.

## nghttp2 notes

nghttp2.patch is generated by cloning the nghttp2 repo and make a change to the CMakeLists.txt, and
copy the diff.
